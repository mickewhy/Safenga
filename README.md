# Safenga
My first DiscordJS bot, developed in 2021.

This bot was my introduction to DiscordJS and bot development. All it did was allow two users to play Connect 4 using emojis in Discord Embeds and commands followed by a custom prefix. Though this bot was very simple, it allowed me to explore web app development and API calls for later personal projects outside of my curriculum, and I have since developed several more complex bots.

Safenga was built with Javascript and DiscordJS v12, and was hosted locally every time someone wanted to play Connect 4.
